    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2021 baseball season was one for Nebraska fans to remember. The Scarlet and Cream supporters watched the Huskers cruise through its schedule, playing only Big Ten league games and winning 31 of them. They earned a regular season title, pacing ahead of second place Maryland by four games in the conference standings.\nThe NCAA tournament selection show revealed that Nebraska would eventually face off against the Arkansas Razorbacks, who was the No. 1 overall national seed. Arkansas boasts a fantastic ballpark environment and routinely ranks at the top of the sport’s attendance averages, year in and year out. The Big Red was given the No. 2 seed and scheduled to play Northeastern in the first round, who finished 36-12.\nNebraska’s treatment highlighted the lack of respect given to the Big Ten by the NCAA selection committee. Shortly before the season started, the conference chose to disallow the play of nonconference games due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.\nClearly, this tactic proved to hurt the nation’s view of the Huskers. The decision took away the Husker’s ability to play a full 56-game season, a key advantage that other clubs had on them.\nAfter considering everything, one might ask: Was Nebraska seeded too low?

We’ll use them and Sports Reference to dive into the numbers.\nThe first question we’ll address is by road winning percentage, what teams played best on the road and proved they don’t rely on winning at home? Here’s Nebraska’s comparison against the top-16 national seeds.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nX2021collegebaseballrecords &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/SPMC 350/Blog/2021collegebaseballrecords.csv\")\n\nteamlist &lt;- c(\"Texas\", \"South Carolina\", \"Oregon\", \"Arkansas\", \"TCU\", \"Florida\", \"East Carolina\", \"Tennessee\", \"Texas Tech\", \"Vanderbilt\", \"Ole Miss\", \"Louisiana Tech\", \"Notre Dame\", \"Stanford\", \"Mississippi State\", \"Arizona\", \"Nebraska\")\n\ntop16 &lt;- X2021collegebaseballrecords |&gt;\n  filter(Team %in% teamlist)\n\nhuskers &lt;- top16 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=top16, aes(x=reorder(Team, RoadWP), weight=RoadWP), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=huskers, aes(x=reorder(Team, RoadWP), weight=RoadWP), fill=\"#E41C38\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Road Winning Percentage\",\n    title=\"Nebraska performed better on the road than it did at home.\",\n    subtitle=\"The Husker's won 74 percent of its road games, better than 14 of the 16 regional hosts.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Warren Nolan | By Jackson Young\"\n    ) +\ntheme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cornhuskers possessed a 14-5 road record (74 percent), good for fifth in college baseball and third compared to the top-16 national seeds selected by the NCAA.

The SEC flexed its muscle on “Selection Monday.”\nIn 2021, Nebraska had one of the best offenses in the Big Ten. In terms of scoring margin, also referred to as run differential, the Big Red scored an average of 7 runs per game while conceding only 4.2 runs. This bubble chart shows Nebraska’s scoring difference of 2.8 runs per game, which ranked them at No. 15 nationally and fifth among the regional hosts.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nX2021collegebaseballoffense &lt;- read_csv(\"2021collegebaseballoffense.csv\")\n\nteamlist &lt;- c(\"Texas\", \"South Carolina\", \"Oregon\", \"Arkansas\", \"TCU\", \"Florida\", \"East Carolina\", \"Tennessee\", \"Texas Tech\", \"Vanderbilt\", \"Ole Miss\", \"Louisiana Tech\", \"Notre Dame\", \"Stanford\", \"Mississippi State\", \"Arizona\", \"Nebraska\")\n\ntop16offense &lt;- X2021collegebaseballoffense |&gt;\n  filter(Team %in% teamlist)\n\nhuskers &lt;- top16offense |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=top16offense, aes(x=RunDiff, y=Team, size=RunDiff), color=\"black\", alpha=.3) + \n  geom_point(data=huskers, aes(x=RunDiff, y=Team, size=RunDiff), color=\"#E41C38\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=2.506667) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Run Differential\", \n    y=\"\",\n    title=\"Nebraska's scoring margin is better than 12 of the 16 national seeds\",\n    subtitle=\"The Big Red is only behind Arkansas, Texas, Arizona and TCU.

A cardinal sin in this phase of the game. They surrendered the least amount of hits and free passes compared to the top-16. They had a competitive earned-run-average of 3.81, close to the apex of the group.\nUnfortunately, the poor perception of Big Ten baseball proved to be the nail in the coffin. But Nebraska’s case to host a regional was valid and the numbers back it up. The performance on the field confirmed it. Nebraska would go on to beat Northeastern and New Jersey Institute of Technology in the first two rounds of the tournament. They beat No. 1 Arkansas once and lost to them twice, with every game going down to the bitter end."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Ohio State vs. Michigan football rivalry is one of the most storied and intense rivalries in college football history. The first meeting between the two blue-bloods happened in 1897 and has continued to present-day, signifying as one of college football’s longest standing rivalries. Michigan has won the last three contests after Ohio State’s six consecutive victories since the start of the College Football Playoff in 2014.\nThe rivalry between Ohio State and Michigan is more than just a game between two teams. It’s a conflict between state cultures, legacies, and traditions. The Ohio State-Michigan game is among the most anticipated games of the college football schedule every year regardless of whether it is played in Columbus or Ann Arbor. So much so that each fanbase refuses to utter the other’s university name during the offseason.\nOhio State has been a dominating force in the college football scene for a very long time. The Buckeyes are known for high-end recruiting classes each and every year, and sending players to the National Football League. Recently, Michigan has developed lower ranked players coming out of high school and made them pro-ready. With over 100 games played in the all-time series, Michigan holds the advantage with a record of 61-51-6.\nSuch a polarizing topic will raise the question: Since the College Football Playoff era started in 2014, who has been the better program (not team), Ohio State or Michigan?\nLet’s take a look at the data.\n247Sports is a sports media company that primarily focuses on college football recruiting. They also produce coverage on college basketball and other sports. We will be using them and CFB stats to dive into the numbers.\nThe first question we’ll address is by taking a look at a necessary aspect of winning that is done off the field. Since 2014, who recruited the best? Who hauled in the most 5, 4, and 3 stars in total? And finally, where did each program finish on average in the recruiting rankings?

In fact, they routinely finish top-five in all of college football almost every season. This makes sense given the Buckeyes spend the most on recruiting and winning attracts great players.\nMichigan and Penn State are the next two best recruiting programs in the Big Ten over the last decade. On average, they finish roughly No. 14 and No. 15 in the nation, respectively. Nebraska follows them at No. 25. But, there’s an elephant in the room now. We should ask the question, is talent acquisition related to NFL draft picks? What schools produced the most pro players since 2014?\n\n\nCode\nosu &lt;- draftpicks |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Ohio State\")\n\nmic &lt;- draftpicks |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Michigan\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=draftpicks, aes(x=reorder(Team, TotPicks), weight=TotPicks), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=osu, aes(x=reorder(Team, TotPicks), weight=TotPicks), fill=\"#BB0000\") +\n  geom_bar(data=mic, aes(x=reorder(Team, TotPicks), weight=TotPicks), fill=\"#00274C\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Draft Picks\",\n    title=\"Who produced the most NFL players since 2014?\",\n    subtitle=\"Ohio State is way ahead of Michigan and the B1G.

The Michigan Wolverines are at 72, including a whopping 13 players in the 2024 season. That’s more than the Buckeyes and Nittany Lions combined. However, the Scarlet and Grey have produced a double-digit number of picks in three of the previous 10 years.\nShifting gears just a little bit, a key statistic that tells a major story of how a college football game is decided, is the turnover margin. Below is a dumbbell chart that displays each program’s turnover difference in the Big Ten since 2014. Green signifies good turnovers (takeaways) and red represents bad turnovers (giveaways).\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=turnovers, \n    aes(y=reorder(Team, TotTakeaways), x=TotTakeaways, xend=TotGiveaways),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"black\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Takeaways\", \n    y=\"\",\n    title=\"The Buckeyes had the fewest turnovers and the most takeaways\", \n    subtitle = \"Since 2014, Michigan had the fewest giveaways, yet they do not consistently force turnovers at a high clip.\",\n    caption=\"Source: CFBStats | By Jackson Young\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeally, you want the distance between the two dots on the line to be as far as possible. Once again, Ohio State excels at both taking the ball away and not giving it to the opposition. Michigan has both a low amount of turnovers but doesn’t force them at a high rate. Clearly both methods equal winning ways but the Buckeyes are still ahead of its competition.\nThe final chart provides a summary of each club’s winning reputation over the last ten years. It combines winning percentage, Big Ten championship titles and CFP appearances brought to you by CFB stats. For most fans, reaching the playoffs is regarded as the highest accomplishment in the sport.\n\n\nCode\nosu &lt;- winning |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Ohio State\")\n\nmic &lt;- winning |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Michigan\")\n\ntitles &lt;- winning |&gt;\n  filter(BigTenTitles &gt; 0)\n\nplayoff &lt;- winning |&gt;\n  filter(CFPApp &gt; 0)\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=winning, aes(x=reorder(Team, WinningPercentage), weight=WinningPercentage), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=osu, aes(x=reorder(Team, WinningPercentage), weight=WinningPercentage), fill=\"#BB0000\") +\n  geom_bar(data=mic, aes(x=reorder(Team, WinningPercentage), weight=WinningPercentage), fill=\"#00274C\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Winning Percentage\"\n    )\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=titles, aes(x=reorder(Team, BigTenTitles), weight=BigTenTitles), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=osu, aes(x=reorder(Team, BigTenTitles), weight=BigTenTitles), fill=\"#BB0000\") +\n  geom_bar(data=mic, aes(x=reorder(Team, BigTenTitles), weight=BigTenTitles), fill=\"#00274C\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Big Ten Titles\"\n    ) \n\nbar3 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=playoff, aes(x=reorder(Team, CFPApp), weight=CFPApp), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=osu, aes(x=reorder(Team, CFPApp), weight=CFPApp), fill=\"#BB0000\") +\n  geom_bar(data=mic, aes(x=reorder(Team, CFPApp), weight=CFPApp), fill=\"#00274C\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"CFP Appearances\"\n    ) \n\nbar1 / bar2 / bar3 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"The Ohio State University is the winningest program in the Big Ten\",\n    subtitle = \"Michigan and Ohio State have been to the playoffs a combined eight times since 2014.\",\n    caption = \"Source: CFBStats | By Jackson Young\"\n  ) & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOhio State and Michigan are tied as the winningest program we’ve ever witnessed with a percentage of .734. Since 2014, the Buckeyes are well ahead of the Wolverines. They’ve achieved five Big Ten championships and also appeared in the CFP five times. Conversely, the Maize and Blue have made it to three consecutive playoffs in their own right. Impressive indeed.\nNow that we’ve gotten to the end of this discussion, let’s answer the question posed at the start of this post. Since the College Football Playoff era started in 2014, who has been the better program (not team), Ohio State or Michigan? The data strongly indicates that Ohio State remains the top-performing program in the Big Ten. Michigan has made a great case by making the playoffs in three straight years but the Buckeyes have had a deeper body of work over a longer period of time.\nLooking to the future, these two programs are in position to dictate both the Big Ten and national landscape of college football. We will see who distances themselves from the other and if any other program can insert itself as a relevant contender in the Big Ten."
